# Sockets with Python

Send data from client to server using Python sockets in **client.py** and **server.py**.

Send data from peer to peer (client to client) using PubNub with **pn_client_1.py** and **pn_client_2.py**.

Install the PubNub package with pip (lastest as of 01/2019):
```bash
pip install 'pubnub>=4.1.2'
```

You **must** put in your **free** PubNub API keys to use **pn_client_1.py** and **pn_client_2.py**. Sign up at [https://dashboard.pubnub.com/signup](https://dashboard.pubnub.com/signup/?devrel_gh=ajb413-python-socket-demo)
